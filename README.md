There doesn't seem to be any clear guidance on creating a vue.js/vite massively multi-page app where the pages are
served by asp.net core mvc and consuming asp.net apis. This is my attempt to put together a solution.
It is still a work in progress, once I'm satisifed with the solution I'll clean it up and document it.
